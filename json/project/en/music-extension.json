As you can see in the picture, each dye color is numerical assigned! What does it mean? It mean if you upload just 1 sound file, that sound will be assigned to the white disc, so on and so on. If you upload multiple sound files, their order will determine which disc will have what sound!<br><br>- Please note that even if you only add 1 sound file or didn't upload anything, the empty discs will still be included, but they won't play anything!"
